IMDB Top 1000 Movies - Data Analysis Project

This project is based on a dataset containing information about the Top 1000 movies listed on IMDB. It includes details like movie titles, release years, ratings, genres, runtimes, directors, cast, votes, and gross earnings.

The purpose of this analysis is to explore and understand patterns in the data, clean any inconsistencies, and extract useful insights using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.

**What I did in this project:**

1. **Explored the dataset:**  
   - Viewed the top rows, checked the number of rows and columns.  
   - Examined data types and identified missing values.

2. **Cleaned the data:**  
   - Converted the runtime column from text (like "120 min") to integers.  
   - Filled missing values in columns like IMDB rating using the mean.  
   - Handled any unnecessary columns or missing information.

3. **Filtered and selected data:**  
   - Found movies with high ratings (e.g. above 8.0).  
   - Listed movies that belong to genres like Action or Sci-Fi.  
   - Filtered movies released between certain years.

4. **Grouped and analyzed:**  
   - Calculated average ratings and vote counts by genre or year.  
   - Identified the year with the most movie releases.  
   - Found which directors appeared most often.

5. **Sorted the data:**  
   - Sorted by highest rating or highest gross revenue.  
   - Also sorted by multiple conditions like rating and runtime.

6. **Visualized the results:**  
   - Created bar charts for genres.  
   - Plotted relationships like runtime vs rating.  
   - Showed trends like how many movies were released each year.
